Implement Vernam cipher - Generate key, Read plain txt / cipher text (from file), Read key (from file),
write output in file.
Generate Key(s) - generate stream of 1's and 0's using Random Number Generator, group them and
write as binary code in a file
Read plain text - plain text (ASCII) from file can be first converted in binary code
If your key is shorter than plain text - repeat the key
Encryption: Plaintext XOR Key
Write output - write cipher text in binary code in a file
Decryption - Ciphertext XOR Key
Write Output - Convert decrypted binary code in ASCII and write in a file
