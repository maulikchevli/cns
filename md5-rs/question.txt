Implement MD5 as below:

Plaintext block size=512 bits. For each step, 32 bits would be used from the block.

rounds= 1 (16 steps) . implement only 1 round. No need to implement 4 rounds.

buffers = 4 (each of size 32 bits)

In each step use plain text from each block, 4 buffers and constant values.

Initialize the buffer values using existing constant values.

Message digest( buffers) of 512 block would be provided as initial buffers for the next 512 plain text block.
